        <p>
          Ever since falling in love with mathematics at age 4, I have been
          fascinated with abstract structures. Being introduced to coding at age
          12, I immediately felt at home in the world of software.
        </p>
        <p>
          My professional career as a developer started after graduating from
          the University of Bergen with a master's degree in Computer Science.
        </p>
        <p>
          Since then, I have contributed to some of the most successful software
          projects in the Stavanger region of Norway.
        </p>
        <p>
          I do all aspects of web; frontend, backend, database, project
          management etc.
        </p>
        <p>
          Respecting humans and the environment is fundamental for all my
          endeavours.
